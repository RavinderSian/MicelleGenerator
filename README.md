# MicelleGenerator
Generates a .gro file of a spherical micelle from a .gro file of a molecule

An example .gro file has been included in this repository.
The .gro files can be visualised using VMD. 

The micelle has a normal distribution of molecules.

The script takes the inputs: radius in nanometers, head atom number, original molecule file name, number of atoms to copy and number of molecules desired for micelle.

Example micelle:
